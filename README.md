So, that's my own two scripts as I use every time, and I hope the scripts will save your very expensive time when you will need prepare the clear Linux for work with Magento, and install the Magento projects.

# soft_installer.sh
This script will help you install base pack for work with Magento. (Apache, MySQL(MariaDB), Git, PHP, phpmyadmin, Composer, ElasticSearch)

# project_installer.sh
This script will help you install Magento from git with https link. The script will set up all that you need for correct work with your project.
